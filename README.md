# Kinetic Canvas

**An AI-Powered Hand Tracking Art Installation**  
*Human Augmentation through Computer Vision*

## 🎨 Concept

Kinetic Canvas transforms your hand into a precision digital brush using AI and computer vision. Visitors paint trails of light, geometry, and color in the air using only their gestures—no physical tools required.

This project demonstrates how AI can augment human creativity and provide accessible art-making tools for people with limited motor skills or those who cannot hold traditional brushes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running Locally

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Install the "Live Server" extension (if you don't have it)
3. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"
4. Allow camera access when prompted
5. Point your index finger at the camera and start creating!
